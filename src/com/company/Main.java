//stuff we've covered so far'

/*
how to use
-basic introductions
-System.out
-Input from the user
-data types
-if else statements
-while loops
Introduced Multiple Classes
-manipulating multiple classes, takeaway, has to all be in the same folder for it to work well
-methods with parameters
-instance variables
-multiple methods within a class
-using a constructor
-nested if statements, don't really need practice on this
-else if
-conditional operators ... ? ... : ...
-implementing sth
-for loop
-compound interest calc.
-do while when you're looking for at least one run in your program
-useful functions in the math class
-random number gen
-arrays you only have one data type in java unlike lists
-array table
-summing all elements in an array
-creating an array that keeps tally
-enhanced for loop, similar to for in python
-arrays in methods
-multidimensional arrays
-variable length args ... means we don't know hoe many numbers, super important
-creating time functionality
-public, private, this | when you use this, think about this method
-overloaded constructors, code constructors being versatile enough to handle different scenarios
-toString, pretty much like __str__ in python
-43*composition, a little complicated, referencing objects in other classes
-enumeration, similar to how it works in python but still just a little weird
-enumset, very similar to slicing
-static, share a variable within class
-enums, you can directly index enums using .values, interesting
-final, you can never change it after you've defined it.
-inheritance, helps to have a central parent version of a class that others can take if they like
-extends keyword is super important in the process of inheritance
-graphical user interfaces *star eyess*
-started with using joption panes
-tailoring your gui across windows and mac for a consistent feel :)
-event handling, super detailed
-polymorphism
